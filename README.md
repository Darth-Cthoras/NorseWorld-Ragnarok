# NorseWorld: Ragnarok

Copyright (c) 2002-2008, Alchemist Team

The development of this game was begun at november 2002, 
as remake of Ragnarok game, created in 1992-1995
by Thomas Boyd and Robert Vawter.

In this roguelike-game, created on base of scandinavian mythology, 
you are brave viking, who must help the aces (the gods) to win in Ragnarok - 
the final battle against evil. This battle will determine the fate of nine worlds.

You begin in your village and can choose between the ways of viking warrior, woodsman, 
blacksmith, alchemist, conjurer or sage. Each way is different from others and has 
its own advantages and disadvantages, each new game is totally unique:
worlds and their levels, lands, creatures, items and even
merchants are randomly generated.

Playing the game you will pass through Midgard - the world of mortals, 
visit Jotenheim - the land of giants-jotuns, and Nidavellir - 
the labyrinth of caves, populated strange creatures, come down 
in dwarven great caves; you have a chance to visit lands, 
created by gods and greatest of ancient wizards, get through
terrible Niflheim - the world of deads and search the mighty 
artifacts of the gods. Then you'll go to Asgard - the world of gods, 
to take part in final battle against powers of evil.
